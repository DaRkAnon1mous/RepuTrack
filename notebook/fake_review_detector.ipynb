    "- Modules (ready‑made building blocks like layers, optimizers, losses).\n",
    "- In your code, PyTorch is handling:\n",
    "- The dataset (Dataset and DataLoader classes).\n",
    "- The training loop (forward pass, loss calculation, backward pass, optimizer step).\n",
    "- Moving data and models to GPU/CPU (.to(device)).\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 What are Tensors?\n",
    "- A tensor is just a multi‑dimensional array (like a matrix, but more general).\n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "- Scalar → 5 (0D tensor).\n",
    "- Vector → [1,2,3] (1D tensor).\n",
    "- Matrix → [[1,2],[3,4]] (2D tensor).\n",
    "- Higher dimensions → images, batches of text, etc.\n",
    "- PyTorch tensors can live on GPU, which makes training super fast compared to normal Python arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 What is the Attention Mask?\n",
    "- When we tokenize text, we pad shorter sentences to a fixed length (say 256 tokens).\n",
    "- Example: \"hello world\" → [101, 7592, 2088, 102, 0, 0, 0...] (zeros are padding).\n",
    "- The attention mask tells the model which tokens are real and which are just padding.\n",
    "- 1 → real token.\n",
    "- 0 → padding.\n",
    "- Without this, the model would waste attention on meaningless padding tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    " Why do we need tensors?\n",
    "- Deep learning models (like DistilBERT) are basically giant math machines.\n",
    "- They don’t understand text directly — they understand numbers.\n",
    "- A tensor is the data structure PyTorch uses to hold these numbers.\n",
    "- Think of a tensor as a container for numbers that can be:\n",
    "- 1D (like a list of token IDs for one sentence).\n",
    "- 2D (like a batch of sentences, each with token IDs).\n",
    "- 3D+ (images, video frames, etc.).\n",
    "The key advantage: tensors can live on the GPU, so millions of operations can be done in parallel very fast. Without tensors, training would be painfully slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 What help are tensors doing?\n",
    "- They allow PyTorch to:\n",
    "- Store the tokenized text (numbers instead of words).\n",
    "- Store the attention mask (1s and 0s for real vs. padded tokens).\n",
    "- Store the labels (like 0 for \"Fake\", 1 for \"Real\").\n",
    "- During training:\n",
    "- These tensors are fed into the model.\n",
    "- The model does matrix multiplications and attention calculations on them.\n",
    "- Gradients (also tensors) are computed and used to update weights.\n",
    "So tensors are the bridge between your text data and the math inside the neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 Why is the dataset being sent as a list?\n",
    "When you create ReviewDataset(X_train.tolist(), y_train.tolist(), tokenizer):\n",
    "- X_train and y_train are often NumPy arrays or Pandas series.\n",
    "- .tolist() converts them into Python lists because the custom Dataset class expects normal lists it can index with __getitem__.\n",
    "- Lists are easier for PyTorch’s Dataset to handle when fetching samples one by one.\n",
    "So: lists = simple containers of text and labels → dataset wraps them → DataLoader batches them.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 What is the DataLoader and what is it doing?\n",
    "Think of DataLoader as a waiter in a restaurant:\n",
    "- The Dataset is the kitchen (it has all the food = samples).\n",
    "- The DataLoader is the waiter who brings food to the table in small batches.\n",
    "- The Model is the customer who eats the food (learns from the data).\n",
    "What DataLoader does:\n",
    "- Batching: Instead of giving the model one sentence at a time, it gives (say) 16 sentences together. This speeds up training and stabilizes learning.\n",
    "- Shuffling: Randomizes the order of samples each epoch so the model doesn’t memorize sequence patterns.\n",
    "- Parallel loading: Can fetch data using multiple workers (threads) to keep GPU busy.\n",
    "So DataLoader = efficient delivery system for data → model.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 What is AdamW and how does it optimize the model?\n",
    "Optimization = how the model learns by adjusting its weights.\n",
    "AdamW in simple terms:\n",
    "- Adam = Adaptive Moment Estimation. It’s like a smart gradient descent:\n",
    "- It looks at the gradient (direction of error).\n",
    "- It keeps track of past gradients (momentum) so it doesn’t zig‑zag too much.\n",
    "- It adapts the learning rate for each parameter individually.\n",
    "- W = Weight Decay. This prevents weights from growing too large (regularization).\n",
    "What happens during optimization:\n",
    "- Model makes a prediction → compares with true label → computes loss.\n",
    "- PyTorch calculates gradients (how much each weight contributed to the error).\n",
    "- AdamW uses these gradients to adjust weights slightly in the right direction.\n",
    "- Example: if a weight made the model predict too high, AdamW nudges it lower.\n",
    "- Repeat for many batches → model gradually learns patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 Putting it all together (flow)\n",
    "- Dataset → holds text + labels.\n",
    "- DataLoader → batches them into tensors.\n",
    "- Model → takes tensors, runs forward pass, outputs predictions.\n",
    "- Loss → measures how wrong predictions are.\n",
    "- Backpropagation → computes gradients.\n",
    "- AdamW optimizer → updates weights using gradients.\n",
    "- Repeat for many epochs → model improves accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "⚡ Simple analogy:\n",
    "- Dataset = library of books.\n",
    "- DataLoader = librarian who brings 16 books at a time.\n",
    "- Model = student reading books.\n",
    "- Loss = exam score showing mistakes.\n",
    "- AdamW = teacher correcting the student’s notes so they improve next time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 Why do we need the loop for each epoch?\n",
    "Let’s break it down:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. `model.train()` alone is not enough\n",
    "- `model.train()` just **switches the model into training mode** (turns on dropout, etc.).  \n",

    "- Training requires:  \n",
    "  - Feeding data (forward pass).  \n",
    "  - Calculating loss.  \n",
    "  - Backpropagation (gradients).  \n",
    "  - Optimizer step (update weights).  \n",
    "- That’s why we need the loop — to actually perform these steps repeatedly.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. The **epoch loop** ensures repeated exposure\n",
    "- One epoch = model sees the entire dataset once.  \n",
    "- But one pass is not enough — the model won’t learn well from just one look.  \n",
    "- Multiple epochs = repeated practice.  \n",
    "- Each epoch refines the weights further, reducing loss and improving accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. The **batch loop** inside each epoch\n",
    "- Datasets are too big to feed all at once (memory issue).  \n",
    "- So we split into **mini‑batches** (e.g., 16 samples).  \n",
    "- For each batch:\n",
    "  1. Forward pass → model predicts.  \n",
    "  2. Loss → compare prediction vs. true labels.  \n",
    "  3. Backward pass → compute gradients.  \n",
    "  4. Optimizer step → update weights.  \n",
    "- Repeat until all batches are done → that completes one epoch.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 Why can’t we just do one epoch?\n",
    "- Imagine learning multiplication tables:\n",
    "  - If you study them once, you’ll forget quickly.  \n",
    "  - If you repeat them multiple times, you get better and faster.  \n",
    "- Same with the model:  \n",
    "  - One epoch = rough first attempt.  \n",
    "  - More epochs = gradual refinement.  \n",
    "  - Too many epochs = risk of memorizing (overfitting).  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 Full training loop explained in simple flow\n",
    "1. **Set training mode** → `model.train()`.  \n",
    "2. **Epoch loop** → repeat training passes (e.g., 3 times).  \n",
    "3. **Batch loop** → for each mini‑batch:  \n",
    "   - Get tensors (`input_ids`, `attention_mask`, `labels`).  \n",

    "- Load GloVe embeddings → instead of random numbers, we give each word a pretrained vector that already encodes meaning.\n",
    "This way, the BiLSTM doesn’t start from scratch — it already knows that “king” is close to “queen”, or “happy” is opposite of “sad” in vector space.\n",
    "\n",
    "- GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation):\n",
    "Pretrained embeddings learned from billions of words. They capture semantic relationships.\n",
    "Example: vector(“Paris”) – vector(“France”) + vector(“Italy”) ≈ vector(“Rome”).\n",
    "- BiLSTM (Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory):\n",
    "A sequence model that reads text both forward and backward.\n",

    "- Backward LSTM: captures context from right to left.\n",

    "- GloVe gives word-level meaning.\n",
    "- BiLSTM adds sentence-level context.\n",
    "This is powerful for tasks like sentiment analysis, intent detection, or text classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "📖 Small Example (no code, just concept)\n",
    "Imagine the sentence:\n",
    "“The movie was not good.”\n",
    "- Step 1: Vocabulary + GloVe\n",
    "Each word gets a vector:\n",
    "- “movie” → [0.12, -0.45, …]\n",
    "- “good” → [0.88, 0.34, …]\n",
    "- “not” → [0.55, -0.22, …]\n",
    "- Step 2: BiLSTM reads the sequence\n",
    "- Forward LSTM sees: “The → movie → was → not → good”\n",
    "- Backward LSTM sees: “good → not → was → movie → The”\n",
    "- Step 3: Context understanding\n",
    "- Forward path might think “good” is positive.\n",
    "- Backward path sees “not” before “good” and adjusts meaning.\n",
    "- Together, BiLSTM understands the sentence is negative sentiment.\n",
    "So the GloVe embeddings give the model a head start on what “good” and “not” mean, and the BiLSTM ensures the order and context are correctly interpreted.\n",
    "\n",
    "✨ In short:\n",
    "We use GloVe so words start with rich semantic meaning, and BiLSTM so the model understands how those words interact in context.\n",
    "Would you like me to also show you a visual analogy (like a diagram-style explanation of how embeddings flow into BiLSTM)? That often makes the “why” click even faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧩 Step 1: Making a Vocabulary\n",

    "df['cleaned'] =\n",
    "[\"the movie was good\",\n",
    " \"the movie was not good\",\n",
    " \"the actor was amazing\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`all_words`** → collects every word:  \n",
    "  `[\"the\",\"movie\",\"was\",\"good\",\"the\",\"movie\",\"was\",\"not\",\"good\",\"the\",\"actor\",\"was\",\"amazing\"]`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`Counter(all_words)`** → counts frequency:  \n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  the: 3\n",
    "  movie: 2\n",
    "  was: 3\n",
    "  good: 2\n",
    "  not: 1\n",
    "  actor: 1\n",
    "  amazing: 1\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`vocab = ['<PAD>', '<UNK>'] + [word for word,count in vocab.most_common()]`**  \n",
    "  Adds special tokens first, then words sorted by frequency:  \n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  ['<PAD>', '<UNK>', 'the', 'was', 'movie', 'good', 'not', 'actor', 'amazing']\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 This is your **vocabulary list**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "What are <PAD> and <UNK> used for?\n",
    "- <PAD> (Padding token):\n",
    "- Neural networks usually expect all input sequences to be the same length.\n",
    "- But sentences vary: \"the movie was good\" has 4 words, \"the actor was amazing\" has 4, \"the movie was not good\" has 5.\n",
    "- To make them equal length, we add padding tokens at the end (or beginning).\n",
    "- Example: if we fix length = 6, then:\n",
    "- \"the movie was good\" → [2,4,3,5,0,0] (where 0 = <PAD>).\n",
    "- Padding ensures the model can batch-process sentences together.\n",
    "- <UNK> (Unknown token):\n",
    "- Sometimes a word appears in your dataset that wasn’t in your vocabulary or GloVe file.\n",
    "- Example: \"blockbuster\" might not be in your vocab.\n",
    "- Instead of crashing, the model replaces it with <UNK> (index 1).\n",
    "- This way, the model can still handle unseen words gracefully.\n",
    "👉 Together, <PAD> and <UNK> make the system robust:\n",
    "- <PAD> = “empty filler” to align sequence lengths.\n",
    "- <UNK> = “catch-all” for unknown words.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔢 Step 2: Turning Words into Numbers\n",
    "- **`word_to_idx`** → assigns each word an index:  \n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  {\n",
    "   '<PAD>':0, '<UNK>':1,\n",
    "   'the':2, 'was':3, 'movie':4,\n",
    "   'good':5, 'not':6, 'actor':7, 'amazing':8\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "So now:\n",
    "- Sentence `\"the movie was good\"` becomes `[2,4,3,5]`.  \n",
    "- Sentence `\"the movie was not good\"` becomes `[2,4,3,6,5]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 That’s how text becomes **numerical values** (indices).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📐 Step 3: What is a Vector?\n",
    "A **vector** here means a list of numbers (not just one number).  \n",
    "- Each word is represented by a **300-dimensional vector** (300 numbers).  \n",
    "- Example (simplified):  \n",
    "  `\"good\"` → `[0.88, 0.34, -0.12, … up to 300 values]`  \n",
    "  `\"bad\"` → `[0.12, -0.56, 0.77, …]`\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 So it’s not a single number, it’s a **long list of numbers** that encodes meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📂 Step 4: Reading the GloVe File\n",
    "The GloVe file (`glove.6B.300d.txt`) is a huge text file where each line looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "good 0.88 0.34 -0.12 ... (300 numbers)\n",
    "bad 0.12 -0.56 0.77 ... (300 numbers)\n",
    "movie 0.45 -0.22 0.91 ... (300 numbers)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **first word** is the token (`good`, `bad`, etc.).  \n",
    "- The **next 300 numbers** are its vector.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The code reads each line, checks if the word is in your vocabulary, and if yes → puts its vector into the `embedding_matrix` at the right index.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Step 5: Why 300?\n",
    "- **300** is the embedding dimension chosen when GloVe was trained.  \n",
    "- It means each word is represented by a vector of length 300.  \n",
    "- More dimensions = more expressive meaning, but also heavier computation.  \n",
    "- 300 is a sweet spot: captures rich semantic info without being too large.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 Step 6: How it Helps\n",
    "- Your vocabulary gives each word an **index**.  \n",
    "- GloVe gives each word a **vector of meaning**.  \n",
    "- Together, you get an **embedding matrix**:  \n",
    "  - Row 2 (for “the”) → vector of 300 numbers.  \n",
    "  - Row 5 (for “good”) → vector of 300 numbers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When the BiLSTM runs, instead of just seeing `[2,4,3,5]` (plain numbers), it sees the **embedding vectors** that carry semantic meaning. That’s why the model can understand “good” vs “bad” beyond just their IDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **In short:**  \n",
    "- Vocabulary = word → index.  \n",
    "- GloVe file = word → 300-number vector.  \n",
    "- Code combines them into `embedding_matrix`.  \n",
    "- BiLSTM uses this matrix so words start with rich semantic meaning, not random numbers.  \n",
