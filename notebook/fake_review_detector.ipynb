    "- It provides:\n",
    "- Tensors (its basic data structure, like NumPy arrays but with GPU support).\n",
    "- Automatic differentiation (so gradients for backpropagation are calculated automatically).\n",
    "- Modules (ready‑made building blocks like layers, optimizers, losses).\n",
    "- In your code, PyTorch is handling:\n",
    "- The dataset (Dataset and DataLoader classes).\n",
    "- The training loop (forward pass, loss calculation, backward pass, optimizer step).\n",
    "- Moving data and models to GPU/CPU (.to(device)).\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 What are Tensors?\n",
    "- A tensor is just a multi‑dimensional array (like a matrix, but more general).\n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "- Scalar → 5 (0D tensor).\n",
    "- Vector → [1,2,3] (1D tensor).\n",
    "- Matrix → [[1,2],[3,4]] (2D tensor).\n",
    "- Higher dimensions → images, batches of text, etc.\n",
    "- PyTorch tensors can live on GPU, which makes training super fast compared to normal Python arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 What is the Attention Mask?\n",
    "- When we tokenize text, we pad shorter sentences to a fixed length (say 256 tokens).\n",
    "- Example: \"hello world\" → [101, 7592, 2088, 102, 0, 0, 0...] (zeros are padding).\n",
    "- The attention mask tells the model which tokens are real and which are just padding.\n",
    "- 1 → real token.\n",
    "- 0 → padding.\n",
    "- Without this, the model would waste attention on meaningless padding tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    " Why do we need tensors?\n",
    "- Deep learning models (like DistilBERT) are basically giant math machines.\n",
    "- They don’t understand text directly — they understand numbers.\n",
    "- A tensor is the data structure PyTorch uses to hold these numbers.\n",
    "- Think of a tensor as a container for numbers that can be:\n",
    "- 1D (like a list of token IDs for one sentence).\n",
    "- 2D (like a batch of sentences, each with token IDs).\n",
    "- 3D+ (images, video frames, etc.).\n",
    "The key advantage: tensors can live on the GPU, so millions of operations can be done in parallel very fast. Without tensors, training would be painfully slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 What help are tensors doing?\n",
    "- They allow PyTorch to:\n",
    "- Store the tokenized text (numbers instead of words).\n",
    "- Store the attention mask (1s and 0s for real vs. padded tokens).\n",
    "- Store the labels (like 0 for \"Fake\", 1 for \"Real\").\n",
    "- During training:\n",
    "- These tensors are fed into the model.\n",
    "- The model does matrix multiplications and attention calculations on them.\n",
    "- Gradients (also tensors) are computed and used to update weights.\n",
    "So tensors are the bridge between your text data and the math inside the neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 Why is the dataset being sent as a list?\n",
    "When you create ReviewDataset(X_train.tolist(), y_train.tolist(), tokenizer):\n",
    "- X_train and y_train are often NumPy arrays or Pandas series.\n",
    "- .tolist() converts them into Python lists because the custom Dataset class expects normal lists it can index with __getitem__.\n",
    "- Lists are easier for PyTorch’s Dataset to handle when fetching samples one by one.\n",
    "So: lists = simple containers of text and labels → dataset wraps them → DataLoader batches them.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 What is the DataLoader and what is it doing?\n",
    "Think of DataLoader as a waiter in a restaurant:\n",
    "- The Dataset is the kitchen (it has all the food = samples).\n",
    "- The DataLoader is the waiter who brings food to the table in small batches.\n",
    "- The Model is the customer who eats the food (learns from the data).\n",
    "What DataLoader does:\n",
    "- Batching: Instead of giving the model one sentence at a time, it gives (say) 16 sentences together. This speeds up training and stabilizes learning.\n",
    "- Shuffling: Randomizes the order of samples each epoch so the model doesn’t memorize sequence patterns.\n",
    "- Parallel loading: Can fetch data using multiple workers (threads) to keep GPU busy.\n",
    "So DataLoader = efficient delivery system for data → model.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 What is AdamW and how does it optimize the model?\n",
    "Optimization = how the model learns by adjusting its weights.\n",
    "AdamW in simple terms:\n",
    "- Adam = Adaptive Moment Estimation. It’s like a smart gradient descent:\n",
    "- It looks at the gradient (direction of error).\n",
    "- It keeps track of past gradients (momentum) so it doesn’t zig‑zag too much.\n",
    "- It adapts the learning rate for each parameter individually.\n",
    "- W = Weight Decay. This prevents weights from growing too large (regularization).\n",
    "What happens during optimization:\n",
    "- Model makes a prediction → compares with true label → computes loss.\n",
    "- PyTorch calculates gradients (how much each weight contributed to the error).\n",
    "- AdamW uses these gradients to adjust weights slightly in the right direction.\n",
    "- Example: if a weight made the model predict too high, AdamW nudges it lower.\n",
    "- Repeat for many batches → model gradually learns patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 Putting it all together (flow)\n",
    "- Dataset → holds text + labels.\n",
    "- DataLoader → batches them into tensors.\n",
    "- Model → takes tensors, runs forward pass, outputs predictions.\n",
    "- Loss → measures how wrong predictions are.\n",
    "- Backpropagation → computes gradients.\n",
    "- AdamW optimizer → updates weights using gradients.\n",
    "- Repeat for many epochs → model improves accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "⚡ Simple analogy:\n",
    "- Dataset = library of books.\n",
    "- DataLoader = librarian who brings 16 books at a time.\n",
    "- Model = student reading books.\n",
    "- Loss = exam score showing mistakes.\n",
    "- AdamW = teacher correcting the student’s notes so they improve next time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 Why do we need the loop for each epoch?\n",
    "Let’s break it down:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. `model.train()` alone is not enough\n",
    "- `model.train()` just **switches the model into training mode** (turns on dropout, etc.).  \n",
    "- It does **not** actually train the model.  \n",
    "- Training requires:  \n",
    "  - Feeding data (forward pass).  \n",
    "  - Calculating loss.  \n",
    "  - Backpropagation (gradients).  \n",
    "  - Optimizer step (update weights).  \n",
    "- That’s why we need the loop — to actually perform these steps repeatedly.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. The **epoch loop** ensures repeated exposure\n",
    "- One epoch = model sees the entire dataset once.  \n",
    "- But one pass is not enough — the model won’t learn well from just one look.  \n",
    "- Multiple epochs = repeated practice.  \n",
    "- Each epoch refines the weights further, reducing loss and improving accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. The **batch loop** inside each epoch\n",
    "- Datasets are too big to feed all at once (memory issue).  \n",
    "- So we split into **mini‑batches** (e.g., 16 samples).  \n",
    "- For each batch:\n",
    "  1. Forward pass → model predicts.  \n",
    "  2. Loss → compare prediction vs. true labels.  \n",
    "  3. Backward pass → compute gradients.  \n",
    "  4. Optimizer step → update weights.  \n",
    "- Repeat until all batches are done → that completes one epoch.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 Why can’t we just do one epoch?\n",
    "- Imagine learning multiplication tables:\n",
    "  - If you study them once, you’ll forget quickly.  \n",
    "  - If you repeat them multiple times, you get better and faster.  \n",
    "- Same with the model:  \n",
    "  - One epoch = rough first attempt.  \n",
    "  - More epochs = gradual refinement.  \n",
    "  - Too many epochs = risk of memorizing (overfitting).  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 Full training loop explained in simple flow\n",
    "1. **Set training mode** → `model.train()`.  \n",
    "2. **Epoch loop** → repeat training passes (e.g., 3 times).  \n",
    "3. **Batch loop** → for each mini‑batch:  \n",
    "   - Get tensors (`input_ids`, `attention_mask`, `labels`).  \n",
    "   - Forward pass → predictions.  \n",
